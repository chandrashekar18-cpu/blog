     <p align="justify"><font size="+2"</p> Rajamouli started his film career as an apprentice to the veteran film 
      editor Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao and worked with him for six months. Rajamouli recollects,
       "Even in my early 20s, I didn't know how to plan for my future. My father would constantly scold me for doing nothing.
        I joined films just to get away from his nagging. </p><font>

       touted to be a jungle adventure set in Africa, is expected to begin its production in 2024.While attending the 2022 
       Toronto International Film Festival, he revealed more details about the project. "My next film with Mahesh Babu will be
        a globetrotting action adventure. It's going to be a kind of James Bond or Indiana Jones film with Indian roots. In September

    <h2>Film Making</h2>
    <dd>Filmmaking or film production is the process by which a motion picture is produced. Filmmaking involves a number of complex and discrete stages, beginning with an initial story, idea, or commission. Production then continues through screenwriting, casting, pre-production, shooting, sound recording, post-production, and screening the finished product before an audience, which may result in a film release and exhibition. The process is nonlinear, as the director typically shoots the script out of sequence, repeats shots as needed, and puts them together through editing later. Filmmaking occurs in a variety of economic, social, and political contexts around the world, and uses a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques to make theatrical films, episodic films for television and streaming platforms, music videos, and promotional and educational films.
